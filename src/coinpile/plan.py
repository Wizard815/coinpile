"""Savings places, goals with allocations, income, and the monthly plan.

The model in one paragraph: money SITS in "places" (savings accounts, CDs, anything you track as savings). Goals are
things you want it FOR (a house, a car, a laptop). An allocation earmarks part of the savings for a goal, so "free"
money is what is saved minus what is earmarked. Free money can fund a new goal now; when there is none, the goal is
created unfunded and the plan says how long it takes to save for it."""
