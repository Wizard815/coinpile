"""Push alerts to your phone through Mattermost incoming webhooks (Slack-style webhooks work the same way).

Two routes, both set in Settings:
  * CDs and bonds (maturing soon, matured and still sitting there): its own webhook and its own severity floor, default "everything".
    If you never set it, these alerts use the main webhook.
  * Everything else: the main webhook, default floor "warnings and critical".
A new alert is sent once; the same alert is not sent again while it stays active. A critical alert is repeated after 24 hours if it is
still there. When an alert clears and later returns, you are told again. A failed send is retried on the next check, never lost, and one
route failing never blocks the other."""
